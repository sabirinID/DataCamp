## OOP termininology
# That was a lot of terminology at once -- classes, objects, methods, attributesâ€¦ Before you start writing your own object-oriented code, make sure you have a solid grasp on the main concepts of OOP.

# True
# Attributes
# Methods
# Encapsulation
# Great job! Classes and objects both have attributes and methods, but the difference is that a class is an abstract template, while an object is a concrete representation of a class.

## Exploring object interface
"""
The best way to learn how to write object-oriented code is to study the design of existing classes. You've already learned about exploration tools like type() and dir().

Another important function is help(): calling help(x) in the console will show the documentation for the object or class x.

Most real world classes have many methods and attributes, and it is easy to get lost, so in this exercise, you will start with something simpler. We have defined a class, and created an object of that class called mystery. Explore the object in the console using the tools that you learned.
"""

# What class does the mystery object have?
# __main__.Employee

# Print the mystery employee's name
print(mystery.name)

# Print the mystery employee's salary
print(mystery.salary)

# Give the mystery employee a raise of $2500
mystery.give_raise(2500)

# Print the salary again
print(mystery.salary)

## Understanding class definitions
"""
Objects and classes consist of attributes (storing the state) and methods (storing the behavior).

Before you get to writing your own classes, you need to understand the basic structure of the class, and how attributes in the class definition relate to attributes in the object. In this exercise, you have a class with one method and one attribute, as well as the object of that class.
"""

# Arrange the code blocks in the order that will produce the output 6 when run.
# class, def, self.count, mc, mc.set_count, mc.count, print

## Create your first class
"""
Time to write your first class! In this exercise, you'll start building the Employee class you briefly explored in the previous lesson. You'll start by creating methods that set attributes, and then add a few methods that manipulate them.

As mentioned in the first video, an object-oriented approach is most useful when your code involves complex interactions of many objects. In real production code, classes can have dozens of attributes and methods with complicated logic, but the underlying structure is the same as with the most simple class.

Your classes in this course will only have a few attributes and short methods, but the organizational principles behind the them will be directly translatable to more complicated code.

## Using attributes in class definition
"""
In the previous exercise, you defined an Employee class with two attributes and two methods setting those attributes. This kind of method, aptly called a setter method, is far from the only possible kind. Methods are functions, so anything you can do with a function, you can also do with a method. For example, you can use methods to print, return values, make plots, and raise exceptions, as long as it makes sense as the behavior of the objects described by the class (an Employee probably wouldn't have a pivot_table() method).

In this exercise, you'll go beyond the setter methods and learn how to use existing class attributes to define new methods. The Employee class and the emp object from the previous exercise are in your script pane.

Initializing attributes in the constructor is a good idea, because this ensures that the object has all the necessary attributes the moment it is created.

You want to have a constructor that creates BetterDate objects given the values for year, month, and day, but you also want to be able to create BetterDate objects from strings like 2020-04-30.

You might find the following functions useful:

.split("-") method will split a string at"-" into an array, e.g. "2020-04-30".split("-") returns ["2020", "04", "30"],
int() will convert a string into a number, e.g. int("2019") is 2019 .

## Overloading equality
"""
When comparing two objects of a custom class using ==, Python by default compares just the object references, not the data contained in the objects. To override this behavior, the class can implement the special __eq__() method, which accepts two arguments -- the objects to be compared -- and returns True or False. This method will be implicitly called when two objects are compared.

The BankAccount class from the previous chapter is available for you in the script pane. It has one attribute, balance, and a withdraw() method. Two bank accounts with the same balance are not necessarily the same account, but a bank account usually has an account number, and two accounts with the same account number should be considered the same.

## Checking class equality
"""

           other.number

acct = BankAccount(873555333)
Running acct == pn will return True, even though we're comparing a phone number with a bank account number.

It is good practice to check the class of objects passed to the __eq__() method to make sure the comparison makes sense.

## String formatting review
"""
Before you start defining custom string representations for objects, make sure you are comfortable working with strings and formatting them. If you need a refresher, take a minute to look through the official Python tutorial on string formatting.

In this exercise, consider the following code

my_num = 5
my_str = "Hello"

f = ...
print(f)
where the definition for f is missing.

Here are a few possible variants for the definition of f:

1.


f = "my_num is {0}, and my_str is {1}.".format(my_num, my_str)
 
2.


f = "my_num is {}, and my_str is \"{}\".".format(my_num, my_str)
3.


f = "my_num is {n}, and my_str is '{s}'.".format(n=my_num, s=my_str)
4.


f = "my_num is {my_num}, and my_str is '{my_str}'.".format()
"""

# Pick the definition of f that will make the code above print exactly the following:

my_num is 5, and my_str is "Hello".

# There is only one correct answer! Feel free to use the script pane or console to experiment.
# 2
# Great work! To recap: to format a string with variables, you can either use keyword arguments in .format ('Insert {n} here'.format(n=num)), refer to them by position index explicitly (like 'Insert {0} here'.format(num)) or implicitly (like 'Insert {} here'.format(num)). You can use double quotation marks inside single quotation marks and the way around, but to nest the same set of quotation marks, you need to escape them with a slash like \".

## String representation of objects
"""
There are two special methods in Python that return a string representation of an object. __str__() is called when you use print() or str() on an object, and __repr__() is called when you use repr() on an object, print the object in the console without calling print(), or instead of __str__() if __str__() is not defined.

__str__() is supposed to provide a "user-friendly" output describing an object, and __repr__() should return the expression that, when evaluated, will return the same object, ensuring the reproducibility of your code.

In this exercise, you will continue working with the Employee class from Chapter 2.
"""

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, salary=30000):
        self.name, self.salary = name, salary

        s = "Employee name: {name}\nEmployee salary: {salary}".format(name=self.name, salary=self.salary)      
        return s
      
    # Add the __repr__method  
    def __repr__(self):
        
        return "Employee(\"{name}\", {salary})".format(name = self.name, salary = self.salary)   

emp1 = Employee("Amar Howard", 30000)
print(repr(emp1))
emp2 = Employee("Carolyn Ramirez", 35000)
print(repr(emp2))

## Catching exceptions
"""
Before you start writing your own custom exceptions, let's make sure you have the basics of handling exceptions down.

In this exercise, you are given a function invert_at_index(x, ind) that takes two arguments, a list x and an index ind, and inverts the element of the list at that index. For example invert_at_index([5,6,7], 1) returns 1/6, or 0.166666 .

Try running the code as-is and examine the output in the console. There are two unsafe operations in this function: first, if the element that we're trying to invert has the value 0, then the code will cause a ZeroDivisionError exception. Second, if the index passed to the function is out of range for the list, the code will cause a IndexError. In both cases, the script will be interrupted, which might not be desirable.
"""

# MODIFY the function to catch exceptions
def invert_at_index(x, ind):
    
    try : 
       return 1/x[ind]
    
    except ZeroDivisionError: 
        print("Cannot divide by zero!")
    except IndexError:
            print("Index out of range!")
 
a = [5,6,0,7]

# Works okay
print(invert_at_index(a, 1))

# Potential ZeroDivisionError
print(invert_at_index(a, 2))

# Potential IndexError
print(invert_at_index(a, 5))

## Custom exceptions
"""
You don't have to rely solely on built-in exceptions like IndexError: you can define your own exceptions more specific to your application. You can also define exception hierarchies. All you need to define an exception is a class inherited from the built-in Exception class or one of its subclasses.

In Chapter 1, you defined an Employee class and used print statements and default values to handle errors like creating an employee with a salary below the minimum or giving a raise that is too big. A better way to handle this situation is to use exceptions. Because these errors are specific to our application (unlike, for example, a division by zero error which is universal), it makes sense to use custom exception classes.

## Polymorphic methods
"""
To design classes effectively, you need to understand how inheritance and polymorphism work together.

In this exercise, you have three classes - one parent and two children - each of which has a talk() method. Analyze the following code:

class Parent:
    def talk(self):
        print("Parent talking!")     

class Child(Parent):
    def talk(self):
        print("Child talking!")          

class TalkativeChild(Parent):
    def talk(self):
        print("TalkativeChild talking!")
        Parent.talk(self)


p, c, tc = Parent(), Child(), TalkativeChild()

for obj in (p, c, tc):
    obj.talk()

# 4
# Great job! Polymorphism ensures that the exact method called is determined dynamically based on the instance. What do you think would happen if Child did not implement talk()?

## Square and rectangle
"""
The classic example of a problem that violates the Liskov Substitution Principle is the Circle-Ellipse problem, sometimes called the Square-Rectangle problem.

By all means, it seems like you should be able to define a class Rectangle, with attributes h and w (for height and width), and then define a class Square that inherits from the Rectangle. After all, a square "is-a" rectangle!

Unfortunately, this intuition doesn't apply to object-oriented design.
"""

    def __init__(self, w):
        
        Rectangle.__init__(self, w,w)

# The classes are defined for you. Experiment with them in the console.
# For example, in the console or the script pane, create a Square object with side length 4. Then try assigning 7 to the h attribute.
# What went wrong with these classes?
# The 4x4 ...

    def __init__(self, w,h):
        self.w, self.h = w,h

# Define set_h to set h      
    def set_h(self, h):
        self.h = h
      
# Define set_w to set w          
    def set_w(self, w):
        self.w = w 
      
      
class Square(Rectangle):
    def __init__(self, w):
        self.w, self.h = w, w 

# Define set_h to set w and h

        self.h = h
        self.w = h

# Define set_w to set w and h      
    def set_w(self, w):
        self.w = w 
        self.h = w

# Later in this chapter you'll learn how to make these setter methods run automatically when attributes are assigned new values, don't worry about that for now, just assume that when we assign a value to h of a square, now the w attribute will be changed accordingly.
# How does using these setter methods violate Liskov Substitution principle?
# Each ...
# Correct! Remember that the substitution principle requires the substitution to preserve the oversall state of the program. An example of a program that would fail when this substitution is made is a unit test for a setter functions in Rectangle class.

## Attribute naming conventions
"""
In Python, all data is public. Instead of access modifiers common in languages like Java, Python uses naming conventions to communicate the developer's intention to class users, shifting the responsibility of safe class use onto the class user.

Python uses underscores extensively to signal the purpose of methods and attributes. In this exercise, you will match a use case with the appropriate naming convention.

# Properties can prevent creation of new attributes via assignment
# This statement is indeed not true! Properties control only one specific attribute that they're attached to. There are ways to prevent creating new attributes, but doing so would go against the "we're all adults here" principle.

## Create and set properties
"""
There are two parts to defining a property:

first, define an "internal" attribute that will contain the data;
then, define a @property-decorated method whose name is the property name, and that returns the internal attribute storing the data.

If you'd also like to define a custom setter method, there's an additional step:

define another method whose name is exactly the property name (again), and decorate it with @prop_name.setter where prop_name is the name of the property. The method should take two arguments -- self (as always), and the value that's being assigned to the property.

In this exercise, you'll create a balance property for a Customer class - a better, more controlled version of the balance attribute that you worked with before.

# You've put it all together! Notice that the to_csv() method in the original class was using the original created_at attribute. After converting the attribute into a property, you could replace the call to self.created_at with the call to the internal attribute that's attached to the property, or you could keep it as self.created_at, in which case you'll now be accessing the property. Either way works!
