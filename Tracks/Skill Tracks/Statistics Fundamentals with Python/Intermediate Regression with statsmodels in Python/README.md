## Course Description
Linear regression and logistic regression are the two most widely used statistical models and act like master keys, unlocking the secrets hidden in datasets. In this course, you'll build on the skills you gained in "Introduction to Regression in Python with statsmodels", as you learn about linear and logistic regression with multiple explanatory variables. Through hands-on exercises, you'll explore the relationships between variables in real-world datasets, Taiwan house prices and customer churn modeling, and more. By the end of this course, you'll know how to include multiple explanatory variables in a model, discover how interactions between variables affect predictions, and understand how linear and logistic regression work.

1. Parallel Slopes

Extend your linear regression skills to parallel slopes regression, with one numeric and one categorical explanatory variable. This is the first step towards conquering multiple linear regression.

2. Interactions

Explore the effect of interactions between explanatory variables. Considering interactions allows for more realistic models that can have better predictive power. You'll also deal with Simpson's Paradox: a non-intuitive result that arises when you have multiple explanatory variables.

3. Multiple Linear Regression

See how modeling and linear regression make it easy to work with more than two explanatory variables. Once you've mastered fitting linear regression models, you'll get to implement your own linear regression algorithm.

4. Multiple Logistic Regression

Extend your logistic regression skills to multiple explanatory variables. You'll also learn about logistic distribution, which underpins this form of regression, before implementing your own logistic regression algorithm.
