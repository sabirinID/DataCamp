## Course Description

Get an introduction to the programming language Scala. You'll learn why and how companies like Netflix, Airbnb, and Morgan Stanley are choosing Scala for large-scale applications and data engineering infrastructure. You'll learn the basics of the language, including syntax and style, focusing on the most commonly used features in the Scala standard library. You'll learn by writing code for a real program that plays a computer version of the popular card game Twenty-One. You’ll get a taste of the value of a hybrid object-oriented and functional programming language, of which Scala is the foremost example. We recommend this course for learners with intermediate-level programming experience, which can be acquired in the listed prerequisites.

## Chapters
1. A Scalable Language

Welcome to Scala! You'll learn what Scala is, who uses it, and why you should use it. You'll explore four common data types: integers, floating-point numbers, logical values, and text, using the Scala interpreter.

2. Workflows, Functions, Collections

Discover two more ways of writing Scala code (writing a script and building an application) and popular tools that make writing these programs easier. Then, learn what functions do and how to use them, and structure your data using the Array and List collections.

3. Type Systems, Control Structures, Style

Learn about Scala's advanced static type system. After learning how to control your program with if/else, while loops, and the foreach method, you’ll convert imperative-style code to the Scala-preferred functional style.
