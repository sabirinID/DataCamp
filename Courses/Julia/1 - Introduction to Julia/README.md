## Chapters
1. Julia basics

Take your first steps towards coding with Julia and learn what makes this language unique. Learn about variables and data types, and perform simple calculations using Julia scripts and the interactive console.

2. Data structures

Learn how to process text data using strings and how to use arrays to process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. Julia's inbuilt arrays are both powerful and easy to use.

3. Functions and packages

Learn to write code that can make its own decisions using conditional expressions and write functions so you can reuse your code. Plus, learn Julia's powerful function features like broadcasting and multiple dispatch.

4. DataFrames

The DataFrames package is the definitive way to work with tabular data in Julia. You'll use this package to load CSV files and analyze and process this data to get the insights you need.
